<!-- ## What You Need To Do
* **Download/Use the Google Chrome web browser**
* **Create your own information.py file that looks like the following:**
  ```
  product = "enter-product-name-here"
  color = "enter-product-color-here"
  size = "enter-product-size"           # optional: put "" if no size
  category = "enter-product-category-here"
  namefield = "enter-name-here"
  emailfield = "enter-email-here"
  phonefield = "enter-phone-number-here"
  addressfield = "enter-address-here"
  apt = "enter-apartment-number-here"   # optional: put "" if you have none
  zip = "enter-zip-here"
  city = "enter-city-here"
  state = "enter-state-here"    # ex. CO
  country = "enter-country-here"
  number = "enter-card-number-here"
  month = "enter-card-expiration-month-here"
  year = "enter-card-expiration-year-here"
  ccv = "enter-card-ccv-here"
  ```
  *Make sure information.py is in the same directory as main.py.*
  
* **Run the main.py file in the terminal or python shell with the command**
  ```
  python3 main.py
  ```
  *If you're not running python3, make sure to use the correct command to run your python files.* -->
